# Text Generator API

A RESTful API service that generates text using Large Language Models (LLM).

## Overview
This project implements a text generation API that can:
- Generate human-like text responses
- Process natural language prompts
- Leverage advanced LLM capabilities for high-quality text generation

## Structure
The API is built using the following Lamatic Studio nodes:
- **API Request Node**: Handles incoming HTTP requests
- **Text LLM Node**: Powers the text generation using LLM models

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have:
- An active account on [Lamatic Studio](https://studio.lamatic.ai)
- API credentials for your chosen LLM provider
- Basic understanding of REST APIs

## Setup Guide
1. Log in to [Lamatic Studio](https://studio.lamatic.ai)
2. Create a new Flow project
3. Import the provided YAML configuration
4. Configure the Text LLM node by selecting your preferred LLM model
5. Save and deploy your configuration
6. Test the endpoint to ensure everything works correctly

## Usage
After deployment, your API will be ready to:
- Accept text generation requests through the configured endpoint
- Process prompts automatically
- Generate high-quality text responses
- Handle various text generation use cases

## API Integration
The service exposes a REST API endpoint that accepts requests for:
- Text generation
- Prompt processing
- Response customization
